==Issues with RevA1==
* Copywrite mask is mirrored
* Atmega32u2 comes pre-programmed for *EXTERNAL* 8MHz crystal (and clkdiv8): 8MHz square wave must be applied between XTAL1 and XTAL2
** Consider building a boot-strapping jig
* nHWB needs to be broken out
** Consider connecting to SW3? (Easy rework to A1 to do this)
* Accidentally ordered 0603 for R1 and R2 (should be 0402)
* USB port slides far enough side-to-side to short out!!

==Thoughts for RevB==
* Need access to XTAL1/XTAL2 for boot-strap
* Test-point for PC7 (CKOUT)
* Debug pads should be spaced at 0.1", and on both sides of board to accomodate 2x3 pin header
* DNI LED for optional feedback
* Connect SW3 (SW1?) to nHWB through 0ohm resistor
* Move caps further from USB
* Wider USB port (Consider switching to real USB connector? Else may need "wings" to grip USB socket)
